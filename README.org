* mkvcleaner
Tool to bulk-remux mkv-files from tracks of unwanted languages.

It will go through all files in a given directory or work on a single
file. Then it will identify all tracks in that file and remove all tracks
marked with a language that isn't in the list of wanted languages.

** Usage
You can specify either files or directories as arguments. The default set of
languages specified is ~und,eng,swe,jap,jpn~. You can override this list
using the ~--langs~ flag.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  ./mkvcleaner [--langs=und,eng] [--automatic] path/to/directory [path/to/file.mkv] [path/to/other/directory] [â€¦]
#+END_SRC

By default it will prompt the user about the changes to a file to approve the
changes before it's executed. However, if the ~--automatic~ flag is provided
it will skip the confirmation.

** Notes about languages
Always keep ~und~ as a language. Lots of files out there with only one audio
or subtitle track got it's only track marked as ~undefined~ language, so you
probably always want to have ~und~ in your list of wanted languages.

** Notes about audio tracks
If the script filter away all audio tracks, it will choose to not touch them
at all. Instead it will keep all the audio tracks.

** Notes about subtitle tracks
This script may remove all subtitle tracks if there's no tracks matching the
wanted languages list. So you may end up without subtitles.

** Dependencies
It's a go program and it depends on ~ffprobe~ and ~ffmpeg~ from the ~ffmpeg~
project. ~ffprobe~ is used to detect changes.
